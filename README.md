Battleship game

This is a simple 2 player battleship game against the computer. Both you and the computer place a 3 tile battleship on a 5x5 grid, and you then attempt to guess the location of the computer's battleship, while the computer attempts to guess the location of yours. You win by successfully hitting every part of the computer's battleship, before it hits all of yours.
